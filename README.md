# CODE2040
This repository contains my solutions (in Python) to the technical assessment of CODE2040.

In each case, print statements throughout or at the end of my code helped me to detect whether arising errors were occuring as a result of my approach or my syntax.

The greatest lesson I learned during this assessment was the importance of making use of pre-existing code to help me accomplish my tasks. There were plenty of ways to solve these problems, but the elegance was in the simplicity, and hopefuly that came across in my code, even as I continue to improve upon my personal programming style.
